Tasks:
    Person 1:
        Find a valid wordle words list and use the "Random" library to pick one at the begining of the program
        Setup user input loop and input validation(Make sure the word is in the valid words list and make sure it is in the same case as the correct word)

    Person 2:
        Write the code to keep track of guesses (I'd use a list of wordleWords)
        Write the code to print the game state when necessary (wordleWord class has a print() member function)

    Person 3:
        Put together the main game loop



main game loop plan

wordGuessed means word was guessed correctly
wordLimit means 6 guesses limit reached
Done means the user decided to quit

while not Done
    choose a new word and make game state default
    while not wordGuessed and not wordLimit
        print current game state
        prompt for user input and re-prompt if input is invalid
        check users guess against correct word and add it to the game state
    ask if user wants to play again
